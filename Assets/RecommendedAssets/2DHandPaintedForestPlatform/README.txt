Description:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
This package contains sprites of trees, grass and tile-able-ground platform, such graphics can be used in a forest theme based game projects. 
It also includes a sample scene which shows how these assets can be used to construct the level. 
Demo scene has SpriteStrecher.cs script, attach it to any sky background to stretch its width to the screen size (generally it is good to stretch e.g. a 1*1024px size
sprite to the screen width, rather than using 1024*1024 size image to save memory).
Parallex.cs script can be attached to a empty game object and then add various background objects to it, an example can be seen in demo scene.
Attach cameracontroller.cs to your main camera to follow player.
Attach a sprite to the player game object and player script.
